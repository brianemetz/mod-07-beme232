# Wild Turkey Distillery
## Lawrenceburg, Kentucky

This map looks at the Wild Turkey bourbon distillery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky. I chose that area because of the massive terrain differences at the Kentucky River and the differences in ground cover. The map shows different colors for the different ground covers, such as fields, grass, and forests.
